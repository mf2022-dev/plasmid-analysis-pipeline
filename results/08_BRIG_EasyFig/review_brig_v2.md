# BRIG Figure Review Notes

## KPC BRIG Map (HQ_BRIG_KPC_Plasmid.png)
The circular map shows the 131 kb KPC plasmid with KP21915 as reference. The outer two rings show forward and reverse CDS with proper color coding. Seven BLAST comparison rings show high conservation (dark green) across all isolates. AMR gene labels visible around the outside: blaKPC-2, blaCTX-M-65, fosA3, blaTEM-1, rmtB1, catA2, blaSHV-12. GC content track shows variation in the innermost ring. JKPR282 ring shows significant structural differences (large gaps in BLAST coverage). The figure is publication quality with proper legends for both gene categories and BLAST identity.

## NDM BRIG Map (HQ_BRIG_NDM_Plasmid.png)
The 354 kb NDM plasmid shows high conservation across 6 NDM-positive isolates. AMR genes clearly labeled: blaNDM-1, armA, aph(3')-Ia, dfrA5, sul1, mph(A), mph(E), msr(E), qnrS1, aph(3')-VI, sul2. The AMR cluster is concentrated in the lower portion of the circle (~200-240 kb region). All comparison rings show near-complete coverage in dark green, indicating high plasmid conservation.

Both figures are suitable for publication in high-impact journals.
