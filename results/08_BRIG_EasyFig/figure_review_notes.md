# Figure Review Notes

## KPC Plasmid EasyFig (HQ_EasyFig_KPC_Plasmid.png)
- All 8 isolates shown with all genes annotated
- Gene arrows are visible with color coding
- Labels are very small and hard to read - need to increase font size for AMR genes
- The 131kb plasmid is very dense - labels overlap significantly
- Need to make AMR gene labels much more prominent (larger, bolder)
- Hypothetical proteins dominate and create visual noise
- Consider: making hypothetical proteins thinner/more transparent
- Consider: using leader lines for AMR gene labels to avoid overlap
- JKPR282 contig_3 appears shorter - may be a different plasmid structure

## Next steps:
- Increase AMR gene label size significantly
- Add leader lines for key gene labels
- Make hypothetical proteins more subtle
- Consider splitting into segments for better readability
