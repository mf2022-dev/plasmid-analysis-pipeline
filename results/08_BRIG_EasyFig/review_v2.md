# EasyFig v2 Review Notes

## KPC Full Plasmid (HQ_EasyFig_KPC_Full.png)
Much improved over v1. AMR genes have colored label boxes with leader lines. All genes shown with proper color coding. Non-AMR gene labels are small italic grey text. Hypothetical proteins are faded. Good overall layout.

## KPC Zoomed (HQ_EasyFig_KPC_Zoomed.png)
Excellent quality. Shows the 25-75kb AMR region clearly. blaKPC-2 prominently labeled in red. blaSHV-12 in orange. All non-AMR genes labeled in grey italic. Gene arrows are clear with proper directionality. JKPR282 has a different structure (tet(53), sul1, aadA12 instead of blaSHV-12). blaTEM-1 and rmtB1 visible at ~63-65kb. Very good for publication.

## Still need to check: NDM Full and NDM Zoomed figures.
