SNP HEATMAP KEY OBSERVATIONS
==============================

INTRA-STUDY (SA vs SA):
- Most pairs: 0-14 SNPs (deep red = very few SNPs)
- JKPB244 vs JKPB284: 14 SNPs (most distant within study)
- KP21802 vs MDRKP122: 0 SNPs (identical)
- JKPB381 is closest to JKPB284 (2 SNPs) and JKPR282 (2 SNPs)

STUDY vs GLOBAL:
- KX236178 (China, 121 kb) is the most divergent: 193-242 SNPs from all
- CP073303 (China, 126 kb) is closest to our plasmids: 1-7 SNPs
- CP097693 (China, 131 kb) also very close: 5-14 SNPs
- MZ709016 (China, 128 kb) close: 4-13 SNPs
- MT648513 (Egypt, 130 kb): 19-30 SNPs from our plasmids

NOTABLE: CP073303 differs by only 1 SNP from JKPB381 - nearly identical!
This Chinese plasmid (pSW1780-KPC, 125.6 kb) is the closest global match.
